# Challenge Two - Basic Variables and Input

The goal of this challenge is to create an application that asks the user their name and then prints this statement to the terminal:
        
        Hello, user.

Whereas the word user should be replaced with the name they typed into the terminal when asked this statement:

        What is your name?

For example the terminal should appear like this:

        What is your name? Kyle
        Hello, Kyle.

## Lessons learned:

- String Variables - https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html 
- creating string variables that can call the input function
- creating a string variable that concatenates string literals which dynamic string variables
- The Input Function - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-input-function/ 
- The Print Function - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-print-function/
