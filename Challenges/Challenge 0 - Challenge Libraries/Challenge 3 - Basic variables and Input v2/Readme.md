# Challenge 3 - Basic Variables and Input v2

This is a continuation of Challenge 2. The goal of this challenge is to store multiple user inputs into different variables and print a line back that concatenates the variables with string literals.  

Lines needed to be printed into the terminal:

        What is your name?
        What is your age?
        What is your goal career field?
        What is your goal salary?

        My name is user. My age is xx. My goal career field is blank and my goal salary is $000000 annually.

Terminal example w/ user input:

    What is your name? kyle
    What is your age? 33
    What is your goal career field? software development
    What is your goal salary? 100000

    My name is Kyle. My age is 33. My goal career field is Software Development and my goal salary is $100000 annually.
