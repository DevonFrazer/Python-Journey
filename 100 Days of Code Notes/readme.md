# **MAZE ESCAPE**
## Utilization
This Python coding had pre-determined functions on a site called Reeborg's World (This site was provided by the Udemy Python Course) where a random 'flag' was randomly placed in a pre made maze. The code I made allowed me to move the robot to wherever the flag was planted no matter where the robot started.
## Lessons Learned
1. Defining and Calling Python functions.
2. While Loops = While something_is_true: Do this, Then do this, Then do this. Also need to be careful to avoid it becoming an infinite loops.
3. Need to check the code every few steps to make sure it is running correctly to help debug and to also help avoid having an infinite loop.
